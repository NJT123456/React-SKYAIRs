# React-SKYAIRs

I changed the tools used to create the web application and remade the [project CPE231](https://github.com/NJT123456/SKYAIRs) basic web application for booking airline tickets.

Tools
- Database : MySQL
- Backend Framework: Node.js
- Frontend Framework : Next.js
- Test Web application : Robot Framework by SeleniumLibrary

# What to do
1. Update the database with the table data for Locations and Tickets.
2. Launch 2 Powershell and enter the following code.  
  2.1 First Powershell
   
   ``` bash
    cd server; npm start
    ```
   2.2 Seconde Powershell

   ``` bash
    cd skyairs; npm run dev
    ```
